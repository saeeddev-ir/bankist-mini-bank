# bankist-mini-bank

bankist a mini bank app that was created by me and I use HTML, CSS and above all JavaScript.
this app has many features that I'm going to mention some of them.

1. If you open the project, you need to login to your account.[some of sample account are:
   (user: js / pass: 1111), (user: jd / pass: 2222), (user: stw / pass: 3333), (user: ss / pass: 4444)

2. When you login to the account, you can see your deposits and withdrawals. also you can see the total budget that you have.
3. Furthermore, there are more features in this app such as transfering money to someone, you can request for a loan, and also
you can close your account.

this small app is one of my best projects.

Hope you like it
